<p>Thorne's Ultimate-E, containing mixed tocopherols, is a source of antioxidant activity in fat-soluble tissues. Extensive clinical studies have demonstrated the significant benefits of vitamin E for cardiovascular health. What sets Ultimate-E apart is its natural tocopherol ratio, making it an efficient way to supplement vitamin E without the use of soy oil as a filler. Recent research has also pointed to the enhanced antioxidant effect of mixed tocopherols compared to alpha-tocopherol alone, indicating its superior potency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thorne's vitamin E is carefully extracted from a blend of vegetable oils, including soy, with a meticulous distillation process to remove any potentially allergenic soy residue. Ultimate-E is not diluted with soy oil, ensuring a pure and potent product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tocopherols, the active components of vitamin E, play an important role in protecting against free radicals and oxygenation by-products like lipid peroxides and singlet oxygen radicals. Also, gamma-tocopherol, present in Ultimate-E, stops the enzyme cyclooxygenase, contributing unique advantages not observed with alpha-tocopherol alone. Human studies comparing diets supplemented with gamma- and alpha-tocopherols to those primarily supplemented with alpha-tocopherol have shown that the mixed-tocopherol group provides superior DNA protection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's important to note that the tocopherol profile in Ultimate-E may vary slightly from batch to batch due to its natural source.

    ""value"": ""Thorne’s Broccoli Seed Extract is not just another antioxidant supplement, it is a powerful, long-lasting defence system for your cells. Traditional antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta carotene offer short-lived protection, typically neutralising free radicals for only a few hours. But this supplement takes a different approach. Once ingested, it undergoes a unique breakdown process in the gut, releasing sulforaphane. This potent compound doesn't just act directly, it triggers your body’s own detoxification and antioxidant enzymes, providing cellular protection that lasts for several days. This extended protection is crucial, especially in today’s world where our bodies are constantly exposed to oxidative stress from pollution, processed foods, and daily stressors. Thorne’s Broccoli Seed Extract doesn’t just provide a quick fix, it equips your body with the tools to continually defend itself against ongoing threats, helping to maintain cellular health over time.\n<br><br>\nThe science behind sulforaphane is robust, with more than 500 journal articles published in the past two decades. This wealth of research highlights its role in promoting not only antioxidant defence but also in supporting detoxification pathways, reducing inflammation, and even influencing gene expression related to health and disease. By incorporating sulforaphane into Thorne’s Broccoli Seed Extract, you’re not just getting a supplement – you’re receiving a research-backed, comprehensive approach to long-term health and vitality.\n<br><br>\nThorne sets the standard for excellence in the supplement industry.

<ul>
<li>Anti-inflammatory properties</li>
<li>Clearance of senescent cells and anti-aging support</li>
<li>Supports a healthy cardiovascular system</li>
</ul>
<p>Quercetin's capacity to lower oxidative stress is essential for expediting post-exercise recovery, and this formula is combined with Vitamin C, another antioxidant, to enhance the supplement's benefits and augment the absorption of Quercetin in the body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One contributing factor to delayed recovery during physical training can be attributed, in part, to oxidative stress, and Quercetin is recognized for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory attributes. Quercetin operates as a guardian against reactive oxygen species, safeguarding against lipid peroxidation. <meta charset=""utf-8""><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">Scientific research unequivocally demonstrates Quercetin's ability to combat inflammation. In particular, its role in addressing the age-related increase in inflammation, is noteworthy. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quercetin also excels in the clearance of senescent cells, contributing to the overall improvement of bodily functions. Acting as a detoxifying agent, it efficiently eliminates dead cells, making it a potent detoxifier. Supported by multiple studies, Quercetin showcases remarkable senolytic effects, underlining its efficacy in enhancing overall health and vitality. Quercetin emerges as a natural champion in promoting a robust cardiovascular system. Its natural composition makes it an ideal choice for those seeking to maintain heart health and overall well-being.</p>

<li>Provides a pure and clean source of energy</li>
<li>Flavour neutral and derived from 100% organic non-GMO coconuts. </li>
</ul>
<p>From the moment you incorporate Performance Lab's MCT Energy Oil into your routine, you'll experience a noticeable enhancement in clarity and the speed of your thoughts. Say goodbye to sluggishness and hello to sustained energy throughout your day, especially during exercise.

<p> </p>
<p>What are MCTs? <meta charset=""UTF-8""></p>
<p>Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) represent healthy fats present in coconut oil. There are four distinct MCTs, with carbon atom chains spanning from 6 to 12 in length. They potentially serve as an ultimate source of fuel to enhance brain function and metabolic processes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Performance Lab MCT provides only C8/C10 MCTs, which are regarded as the most efficient and advantageous variants.</strong> They offer a range of important benefits:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>They are absorbed swiftly, akin to glucose, offering a fat-based energy source that emulates carbohydrates.</li>
<li>They convert efficiently in the liver into ketones, promoting nutritional ketosis.</li>
<li>They optimize the functionality of cellular mitochondria, which is vital for brain health and mental energy.</li>
<li>They boost the utilization of fat for energy and contribute to increased energy expenditure, aiding in fitness and weight management.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Crosses the blood-brain barrier for improved sleep quality</li>
<li>Reduces stress-related biomarkers and enhances mental focus</li>
<li>Shortens sleep latency and increases REM sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>GABA presents a natural and effective way to access the calming neurotransmitter known as Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA). GABA plays a crucial role in promoting relaxation, making it easier to achieve restful sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the primary neurotransmitter for the central nervous system, GABA functions as the body's essential tool for putting a stop to nervous excitement within the brain and nervous system. Scientifically supported clinical studies have demonstrated the value of supplemental GABA in facilitating a relaxation response, crossing the blood-brain barrier, and enhancing the ease of falling asleep and staying asleep. GABA's effects on the brain are profound. It diminishes stress-related beta waves while boosting the production of alpha-waves, creating a physical state of deep relaxation without compromising mental clarity.<br></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Research has also indicated that GABA has the potential to reduce pupil diameter, heart rate, and key biomarkers of stress, such as salivary cortisol and chromogranin A. Studies reveal that GABA contributes not only to quicker sleep onset but also the potential for increased time spent in the restorative REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep. This suggests a more comprehensive and rejuvenating sleep experience for users.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>LIPO GABA employs a proprietary liposomal encapsulation process, ensuring the stability and maximum absorption of GABA. Unlike traditional GABA supplements, which often suffer from poor bioavailability due to digestion, this innovative formula safeguards the integrity of GABA as it passes through your blood stream.</p>

    ""value"": ""How To Play With The Power Ring Set <br><br>\n01. Squat with Chest Press: \nStart in a wide stance with toes pointed out. As you squat down push the Ring directly from your chest out and on the way back up from your squat pull the Ring back into your chest. Repeat as many times as needed. Get after it!<br><br>\n02. Side Lunge Pulse: \nHold a Ring with both hands in front of you and take a large step out to the side of your body to end up in a side lunge where your knees are at a 90 degree angle. Begin to pulse once you’re in the lowest point of your squat lunge and continue to pulse for a desired amount of time. Little movements can get you great results.<br><br>\n03. Reverse Lunge Pulse with Overhead Press: \nWith a Ring in one hand step back into a reverse lunge with one leg and hold. Extend the Ring in your hand overhead and hold and begin to pulse for your desired amount of time. Doin’ double time!<br><br>\n04. Alternating Lifted Heel Squat: \nStart in a wide stance with toes pointed out with the Ring in your hand. Squat down until your knees are at a 90 degree angle and hold the low position. Begin lifting your left heel, pause and then set it down. Then lift your right heel, pause and repeat on the left side. Repeat at your desired tempo. You’ll be burning!<br><br>\n05. Driving the Bus: \nStart in a standing position with the Ring in your hands, holding it like a driving wheel. Lift the Ring up to chest height and while keeping it steady in the middle, slowly turn the Ring to the left and then to the right to where you start feeling a burn in your shoulders. This motion should mimic steering with a driving wheel. Drive yourself to go further!<br><br>\n06. Wood Chop: \nWith a Ring in hand, start in a kneeling position. Bring one foot on the ground in front of you so your knee is at a 90 degree angle. Hold the Ring on the inside of your bent knee and bracing your core slowly swing the weight in a diagonal line across your body so it ends up at the opposite side of your body at the top. Channel your inner lumberjack. <br><br>\n07. Hammer Curl to Press: \nWith the Ring in hand, start in a standing position with arms at sides. Gripping the Ring, curl the weight to meet your shoulder for a bicep burn. Once the Ring is at your shoulder, extend your arm overhead, tracking your wrist over your shoulder. Slowly reverse the movement and repeat as needed. Your upper body go-to!<br><br>\n08. Windmill: \nStand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Turn the toes of your left foot straight to the side at 90 degrees. Reaching your right arm up to the ceiling with the Ring in hand, let your left hand hang down at your side. Look up at your right hand. Engage your core and push your hips toward your right side. Slide your left hand down your left leg toward your ankle as far as possible without putting pressure on your leg, using your core to stabilize yourself. Your left arm should be perpendicular to the floor the entire time and the right leg should remain straight. Allow a slight bend in your left leg. Pause, then push down through your feet to rise back up to start, keeping your core engaged and your spine long the whole time. You’re doing great!""

Melanin overproduction can be triggered by various factors, including genetics, sun exposure, inflammatory skin conditions, hormones, and lifestyle stressors.

<p><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">In addition, in a world where inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to fatigue and low energy, VITAMIN C becomes a beacon of vitality. Furthermore, vitamin C's role in collagen synthesis is vital for maintaining a resilient skin barrier. Acting as a cofactor for key enzymes in the process, VITAMIN C supports collagen stability, promoting smooth, plump skin from the inside out.</p>

BiOptimizers Sleep Breakthrough, offers a revolutionary approach to enhancing sleep quality and reaping numerous health benefits. Designed as a deep sleep formula, it facilitates falling asleep within minutes, ensuring a night of profound, high-quality rest. This breakthrough supplement features elevated levels of potassium, reduced GABA, and the incorporation of Magnolia Bark Extract, all blended into a delicious blueberry flavour. 
<br><br>
Notably, it allows users to seamlessly return to sleep in case of disturbances during the night, promoting an uninterrupted and restorative sleep cycle. The aftermath is remarkable—waking up feeling refreshed, energised, and without the grogginess associated with inadequate sleep. The formula's effectiveness lies in promoting deep sleep, which triggers the production of growth hormones, fat-burning, and muscle-building hormones, contributing to overall rejuvenation.
<br><br>
In contrast to conventional melatonin products, Sleep Breakthrough provides the body with precursors to melatonin and molecules that support natural melatonin production, avoiding the pitfalls of dependency and overdose. Users can experience improved sleep quality without the risk of a ""sleep hangover,"" ensuring they wake up as the best version of themselves—mentally sharp, emotionally resilient, and ready to tackle the day with optimal performance.

<br>
<p>The Prenatal &amp; Postnatal Liquid Multivitamin is a delicious and convenient solution tailored to support both mum and baby’s nutrient demands during pre-conception, pregnancy, and after childbirth. By incorporating this supplement into your daily routine, you're not only preparing your body for pregnancy but also promoting healthy foetal development and supporting your own well-being throughout the entire journey of motherhood.</p>
<p> </p>

By incorporating nutrients like Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and L-lysine, it promotes natural collagen synthesis, while Vitamin C's antioxidant properties protect against free radicals that can damage collagen-producing cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vitamin A</strong> and vitamin C along with L-lysine, an essential amino acid, help to promote natural collagen synthesis and maintain skin health. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vitamin C’s</strong> antioxidant properties quench free radicals that can damage collagen producing cells. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Used in Ayurvedic medicine in India for decades, <strong>Amla fruit</strong> is added to our blend for its help in maintaining collagen metabolism and healthy hair. </p>

By 2022, Ketone-IQ achieved a major breakthrough, introducing the world’s first chirally pure ketone diol—a purer and more effective form of ketone energy. In 2023, they launched Ketone-IQ nationwide, supported by a collaboration with renowned neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman.

<p>Organic Shiitake Tincture offers a myriad of health benefits, particularly in bolstering skin health, enhancing overall well-being, and fortifying the body's defence mechanisms. Originating from ancient China, where it symbolised vitality and youthfulness, Shiitake is packed with essential nutrients, including vitamins B and D, minerals like copper and selenium, as well as potent antioxidants. Shiitake mushrooms support immune function, promote cardiovascular health, and aid in managing cholesterol levels. Moreover, their abundant polysaccharides exhibit anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, contributing to overall wellness and vitality. <br><br>As the only organic certified UK-native functional mushroom producer, Bristol Fungarium ensures sustainability and authenticity in every step of the process. Their products are derived from mushrooms cultivated on an organic farm in Somerset. Using a triple extraction method, where the mushrooms undergo two hot water extractions and a final organic ethanol extraction, in order to preserve the bioactive compounds responsible for its therapeutic properties.

<p>Sencha is a Japanese green tea full of aromatic leaves, and opposed to matcha, Sencha is grown underneath the sun and is renowned for its balance between bitterness, sweetness, and umami.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sencha tea is full of powerful antioxidants which contribute to supporting the health of our cells, protecting us against oxidative stress and free radicals. It is also a source of Vitamin C, which is a powerful vitamin to aid our immune supporting properties, and Vitamin E, the skin loving vitamin which helps to protect us against free radicals which damage cells. The abundance of Vitamin E and other antioxidants found in Sencha works to soothe the skin and boost the protection against oxidative stress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sencha contains a low amount of caffeine compared to coffee or other teas, however, in combination with the presence of L-theanine it promotes cognitive function, increased focus and helps you get that additional boost of mood without the coffee-jitters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to all the nurturing properties of Sencha, it can also support various aspects of maintaining healthy cholesterol levels, aid healthy blood pressure and work synergistically to maintain a healthy metabolism.</p>

<p>Sencha is a timeless elixir and a myriad of beneficial properties which if consumed regularly can foster a holistic wellness experience.</p>

<br>
<p>Matcha is the ultimate drink to boost your energy without the pesky energy slumps. Due to the high concentration of L-theanine and flavanoids, matcha can increase the alpha frequency band in the brain while raising the serotonin, GABA, and dopamine levels which produces a relaxing effect. This effect can help combat stress and calm the nervous system which will help stress-induced hormonal imbalances often leading to hormonal acne.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When L-theanine is paired with caffeine, both naturally occurring in matcha, the amino acid can boost cognitive function, increase focus, and support your energy levels throughout the day. Making matcha the perfect drink for when you need an extra energy boost for your day, increased focus for an important meeting, or just to enjoy while aiding your nervous system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to the high levels of antioxidants found in matcha it is also a beauty secret used by many to improve skin, reduce apperance of acne, and can prevent mild wrinkles as the antioxidants protects us against free radicals and cell damage which ultimately leads to ageing skin. Matcha is also naturally packed with Vitamin B2 and Vitamin E, which both known for boosting collagen and beautifying the skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between matcha and green tea? </strong></p>
<p>Unlike other green teas, when consuming matcha you consume a finely ground powder made from the entire leaf which leaves up to three times more antioxidants than a high quality green tea. Therefore matcha has a higher concentration, giving you more benefits from a smaller amount. Matcha has also been researched to help your immune system, boost metabolism, and improve blood sugar control when consumed regularly.</p>

<p>This peach matcha makes a refreshing matcha latte, but you can also add it directly to your morning smoothie.</p>

</ul>
<br>
<p>Matcha is the ultimate drink to boost your energy without the pesky energy slumps. Due to the high concentration of L-theanine and flavanoids, matcha can increase the alpha frequency band in the brain while raising the serotonin, GABA, and dopamine levels which produces a relaxing effect. This effect can help combat stress and calm the nervous system which will help stress-induced hormonal imbalances often leading to hormonal acne.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When L-theanine is paired with caffeine, both naturally occurring in matcha, the amino acid can boost cognitive function, increase focus, and support your energy levels throughout the day. Making matcha the perfect drink for when you need an extra energy boost for your day, increased focus for an important meeting, or just to enjoy while aiding your nervous system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to the high levels of antioxidants found in matcha it is also a beauty secret used by many to improve skin, reduce appearance of acne, and can prevent mild wrinkles as the antioxidants protects us against free radicals and cell damage which ultimately leads to ageing skin. Matcha is also naturally packed with Vitamin B2 and Vitamin E, which both are known for boosting collagen and beautifying the skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between matcha and green tea? </strong></p>
<p>Unlike other green teas, when consuming matcha you consume a finely ground powder made from the entire leaf which leaves up to three times more antioxidants than a high quality green tea. Therefore matcha has a higher concentration, giving you more benefits from a smaller amount. Matcha has also been researched to help your immune system, boost metabolism, and improve blood sugar control when consumed regularly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This particular variety pack contains a single serve of Davids Tea Watermelon Matcha, Peach Matcha, and Lemonade Matcha making a perfect starting pack for anyone discovering matcha for the first time or simply great flavours to enjoy for the already matcha lover.</p>

<p>Earl Grey is considered by some to be one of the most sophisticated tea blends in the world, made with black tea leaves and lifted up with fragrant notes of citrusy bergamot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Davids Tea has created a blend of Earl Grey tea with a twist of a creamy vanilla and marigolds, introducing a new take on a classic blend. The Earl Grey tea leaves comes from the Camelia Sinesis plant which is filled with antioxidants, polyphenols, flavonoids, and a handful of vitamins and minerals. Thanks to its high potassium content it won't dehydrate your body as a cup of coffee could, however, due to the caffeine it will still give you an energy boost when needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The black tea leaves is also a rich source of L-theanine, which when consumed leads to increased focus and allows you to process information with ease due to the increased alpha frequency bands in your brain. A study conducted by the University of Calabria in Italy, where the bergamot originally came from, found that bergamot extracts helps to decrease the LDL cholesterol and instead increased the HDL cholesterol - meaning its properties could lower the bad cholesterol and raise the good one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although tea usually gets a bad rep for staining your teeth, Earl Grey has been found in dental studies that it can actually be beneficial for your teeth. Earl Grey contains an antioxidant called catechin which has the ability to help the body avoid oral infections, and it also naturally contains fluoride which is a known fighter against decay and protects against cavities.</p>

<li>Boosts concentration</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Matcha is the ultimate drink to boost your energy without the pesky energy slumps. Due to the high concentration of L-theanine and flavanoids, matcha can increase the alpha frequency band in the brain while raising the serotonin, GABA, and dopamine levels which produces a relaxing effect. This effect can help combat stress and calm the nervous system which will help stress-induced hormonal imbalances often leading to hormonal acne.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When L-theanine is paired with caffeine, both naturally occurring in matcha, the amino acid can boost cognitive function, increase focus, and support your energy levels throughout the day. Making matcha the perfect drink for when you need an extra energy boost for your day, increased focus for an important meeting, or just to enjoy while aiding your nervous system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to the high levels of antioxidants found in matcha it is also a beauty secret used by many to improve skin, reduce appearance of acne, and can prevent mild wrinkles as the antioxidants protects us against free radicals and cell damage which ultimately leads to ageing skin. Matcha is also naturally packed with Vitamin B2 and Vitamin E, which both known for boosting collagen and beautifying the skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between matcha and green tea? </strong></p>
<p>Unlike other green teas, when consuming matcha you consume a finely ground powder made from the entire leaf which leaves up to three times more antioxidants than a high quality green tea. Therefore matcha has a higher concentration, giving you more benefits from a smaller amount. Matcha has also been researched to help your immune system, boost metabolism, and improve blood sugar control when consumed regularly.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a delicious addition to your wind-down routine, then this Cinnamon Rooibos Chai might be it. This blend is caffeine free, making it a safe choice for an evening cup of tea or as an after dinner treat with all the benefits included.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cinnamon</strong> promotes balanced blood sugar levels and can help you naturally lower glucose spikes after meals. In addition it is also an antioxidant, has anti-inflammatory properties, and works as a mild antimicrobial due to its active component cinnamaldehyde.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rooibos</strong> is a naturally sweet tasting red bush tea, and is high in antioxidants which mitigate oxidative stress and protects the body from free radicals. Drinking Rooibos regularly can help reduce inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory properties. It contains unique polyphenols such as aspalathin, and is truly an experience for the senses.</p>

<br>
<p>Matcha is the ultimate drink to boost your energy without the pesky energy slumps. Due to the high concentration of L-theanine and flavanoids, matcha can increase the alpha frequency band in the brain while raising the serotonin, GABA, and dopamine levels which produces a relaxing effect. This effect can help combat stress and calm the nervous system which will help stress-induced hormonal imbalances often leading to hormonal acne. When L-theanine is paired with caffeine, both naturally occurring in matcha, the amino acid can boost cognitive function, increase focus, and support your energy levels throughout the day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Matcha is also the perfect drink for when you need an extra energy boost for your day, increased focus for an important meeting, or just to enjoy while aiding your nervous system. Due to the high levels of antioxidants found in matcha it is also a beauty secret used by many to improve skin, reduce appearance of acne, and can prevent mild wrinkles as the antioxidants protects us against free radicals and cell damage which ultimately leads to ageing skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Matcha is also naturally packed with Vitamin B2 and Vitamin E, which both known for boosting collagen and beautifying the skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between matcha and green tea? </strong></p>
<p>Unlike other green teas, when consuming matcha you consume a finely ground powder made from the entire leaf which leaves up to three times more antioxidants than a high quality green tea. Therefore matcha has a higher concentration, giving you more benefits from a smaller amount. Matcha has also been researched to help your immune system, boost metabolism, and improve blood sugar control when consumed regularly.</p>

<p>Sunwarrior’s Collagen Building Protein Peptides - Chocolate Fudge offer a natural solution to replenishing the body's collagen levels, essential for maintaining skin elasticity, joint health, and overall vitality. In today's environment, pollutants in water, air, and food can deplete our collagen reserves, emphasising the importance of replenishment. Unlike traditional collagen supplements sourced from animal tissues, Sunwarrior's plant-based approach harnesses a blend of amino acids, vitamins, and minerals to support the body's innate collagen production mechanisms. <br><br>While the term ""Collagen Building Protein Peptides"" may seem contradictory for a plant-based product, it signifies a formulation rich in amino acids and nutrients crucial for collagen synthesis. Through hydrolysis, the amino acids undergo a process that breaks them down into smaller peptides, enhancing their absorption and utilisation by the body. This innovative approach ensures that individuals can support their collagen production without relying on animal-derived sources, aligning with ethical and dietary preferences.<br></p>

<p><strong>Hyaluronic Acid, Minerals, Biotin:</strong> Enhances the body’s ability to produce and use collagen for smooth and supple skin. HA is naturally occurring in our bodies, but decreases as we age. HA attracts and retains moisture in our skin and aids in the lubrication of joints.</p>
<p><br><strong>Kale &amp; Spinach:</strong> Greens that contain vitamins and antioxidants, supporting your body’s natural collagen production while fighting against free radicals that destroy collagen and elastin.</p>
<p><br><strong>Amla Berries:</strong> Vitamin C is a necessary cofactor in collagen and elastin synthesis.</p>
<p><br><strong>Tremella Mushroom:</strong> Naturally promotes hydration in cells while rejuvenating and maintaining skin elasticity and promoting cell regeneration.</p>
<p><br><strong>Spirulina:</strong> Containing iron and rich with amino acids, spirulina is one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet.</p>
<p><br><strong>Brown Rice &amp; Peas:</strong> This complete amino acid protein has been broken into small peptide chains through hydrolysis. Rice peptides are used for strengthening cell hydration due to their concentration of glutamine and alanine. These nutrients assist the skin to provide moisture retention and environmental protection.</p>
<p><br><strong>Silica from Bamboo:</strong> Silica is a key co-nutrient for collagen and elastin production. It also boosts calcium absorption to strengthen bones, teeth, hair, skin, and nails.</p>

<p>Sunwarrior’s Collagen Building Protein Peptides - Unflavoured offer a natural solution to replenishing the body's collagen levels, essential for maintaining skin elasticity, joint health, and overall vitality. In today's environment, pollutants in water, air, and food can deplete our collagen reserves, emphasising the importance of replenishment. Unlike traditional collagen supplements sourced from animal tissues, Sunwarrior's plant-based approach harnesses a blend of amino acids, vitamins, and minerals to support the body's innate collagen production mechanisms. <br><br>While the term ""Collagen Building Protein Peptides"" may seem contradictory for a plant-based product, it signifies a formulation rich in amino acids and nutrients crucial for collagen synthesis. Through hydrolysis, the amino acids undergo a process that breaks them down into smaller peptides, enhancing their absorption and utilisation by the body. This innovative approach ensures that individuals can support their collagen production without relying on animal-derived sources, aligning with ethical and dietary preferences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Whats inside?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Hyaluronic Acid, Minerals, Biotin:</strong> Enhances the body’s ability to produce and use collagen for smooth and supple skin. HA is naturally occurring in our bodies, but decreases as we age. HA attracts and retains moisture in our skin and aids in the lubrication of joints.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Kale &amp; Spinach:</strong> Greens that contain vitamins and antioxidants, supporting your body’s natural collagen production while fighting against free radicals that destroy collagen and elastin.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Amla Berries:</strong> Vitamin C is a necessary cofactor in collagen and elastin synthesis.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Tremella Mushroom:</strong> Naturally promotes hydration in cells while rejuvenating and maintaining skin elasticity and promoting cell regeneration.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Spirulina:</strong> Containing iron and rich with amino acids, spirulina is one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Brown Rice &amp; Peas:</strong> This complete amino acid protein has been broken into small peptide chains through hydrolysis. Rice peptides are used for strengthening cell hydration due to their concentration of glutamine and alanine. These nutrients assist the skin to provide moisture retention and environmental protection.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Silica from Bamboo:</strong> Silica is a key co-nutrient for collagen and elastin production. It also boosts calcium absorption to strengthen bones, teeth, hair, skin, and nails.</p>

<p>Sunwarrior’s Collagen Building Protein Peptides - Tahitian Vanilla offer a natural solution to replenishing the body's collagen levels, essential for maintaining skin elasticity, joint health, and overall vitality. In today's environment, pollutants in water, air, and food can deplete our collagen reserves, emphasising the importance of replenishment. Unlike traditional collagen supplements sourced from animal tissues, Sunwarrior's plant-based approach harnesses a blend of amino acids, vitamins, and minerals to support the body's innate collagen production mechanisms. <br><br>While the term ""Collagen Building Protein Peptides"" may seem contradictory for a plant-based product, it signifies a formulation rich in amino acids and nutrients crucial for collagen synthesis. Through hydrolysis, the amino acids undergo a process that breaks them down into smaller peptides, enhancing their absorption and utilisation by the body. This innovative approach ensures that individuals can support their collagen production without relying on animal-derived sources, aligning with ethical and dietary preferences. <br></p>

This mineral also help boost energy levels and supports cardiovascular health by positively influencing blood pressure and enhancing cardiac performance. <br><br>Vimergy's Magnesium Glycinate provides 310 mg of magnesium per serving, equivalent to the magnesium found in 10 bananas. This formula is further enriched with organic ginger and turmeric root, known for their anti-inflammatory benefits. This supplement features magnesium in its glycinate form, which has been clinically tested to cause less stomach upset than traditional magnesium supplements, ensuring easier absorption and effective utilisation by the body.</p>",https://gb.healf.com/products/vimergy-magnesium-glycinate,TRUE,8.30064E+12,,gid://shopify/Product/8300642337007,,FALSE,https://gb.healf.com/products/vimergy-magnesium-glycinate,FALSE,"{
